class Item

# Item::valid_date?(date_string)
# This method should accept a string and return a boolean indicating if it is 
# valid date of the form YYYY-MM-DD where Y, M, and D are numbers, such as 
# 1912-06-23. The month should be a number from 1 to 12 and the day should be 
# a number from 1 to 31. Here are examples of the expected behavior:

            def valid_date?(date_string)

            end

# Item#initialize(title, deadline, description)
# This method should accept a title, deadline, and a description as arguments. 
# These three pieces of data should be stored as instance variables of an Item. 
# If the deadline is not a valid date, raise an error.

            def initialize(title, deadline, description)

            end

# Item#title
# This method should return the item's title.

            def title

            end

# Item#title=(new_title)
# This method should set the item's title.

            def title=(new_title)

            end

# Item#deadline
# This method should return the item's deadline.

            def deadline

            end

# Item#deadline=(new_deadline)
# This method should set the item's deadline. However, if the new deadline is not 
# a valid date, then it should raise an error and not change the deadline.

            def deadline=(new_deadline)

            end

# Item#description
# This method should return the item's description.

            def description

            end

# Item#description=(new_description)
# This method should set the item's description.

            def description=(new_description)

            end

end
