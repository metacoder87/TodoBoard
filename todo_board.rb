class TodoBoard

# This is where things comes together. The TodoBoard class will be responsible 
# for receiving user input and performing the correct action on the stored list. 
# In this phase of the app, the board will only manage a single list. 
# Because of this, you may find it trivial to implement these board methods since 
# they simply delegate responsibility to the list methods. We design it in this 
# way in order to have an extensible class that we can easily refactor for 
# more features in phase two.

# You should be using many List methods in the following steps. 
# There is a method to the madness!

# TodoBoard#initialize(label)
# For now, a TodoBoard will only need create a single List with the given label 
# and store it as an instance variable.

            def initialize(label)

            end

# TodoBoard#get_command
# This method should prompt the user to enter a command and perform the 
# appropriate action on the list. The user may enter any of the following 
# commands with arguments separated with spaces:

            def get_command

            end

# TodoBoard#run
# This method will contain our main loop that will keep prompting the user until 
# #get_command returns false.

            def run

            end

end
